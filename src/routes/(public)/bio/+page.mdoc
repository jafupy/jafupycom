# Bio
Hi, I'm Jacob, more commonly known as jafu.py online. I'm 14 years old. I I'm Polish and I live in England. I write code, play classical / fingerstyle guitar and I sometimes play minecraft.

## Programming
I'm self-taught, starting when I was around 10yrs old. 

I started with Python, because I wanted to make a stupid discord bot. Then JavaScript, because I can't remember why exactly but I think it was either to do with web dev or just I wanted to learn another language. 

The first web framework I learnt was [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), and then I had a brief [React](https://reactjs.org/) phase, then returning to Svelte.

I'm also searching to find an excuse to learn [Go](https://go.dev/).
